OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected by this issue.Additional flawsAnother issue fixed in the latest version of OpenSSL is a moderate-severity implementation bug that could cause encryption to fail in some circumstances.AES OCB mode for 32-bit x86 platforms using the AES-NI assembly optimised implementation will not encrypt the entirety of the data. This could reveal sixteen bytes of data that was pre-existing in the memory that wasn’t written, the advisory explains.“In the special case of ‘in place’ encryption, sixteen bytes of the plaintext would be revealed,” it reads.Since OpenSSL does not support OCB based cipher suites for TLS and DTLS, they are both unaffected.This issue affects versions 1.1.1 and 3.0. It was addressed in the releases of 1.1.1q and 3.0.5 on the 5th July 2022.OpenSSL 1.1.1 users should upgrade to 1.1.1q OpenSSL 3.0 users should upgrade to 3.0.5.This article was updated to contain further information.DON’T MISS CWE Top 25: These are the most dangerous software weaknesses of 2022
